In brief, while both languages have regular and irregular verbs, French has a larger number of irregular verbs compared to Spanish, making it more challenging for some learners. Additionally, Spanish often changes the ending of a verb based on its tense, while French changes the entire stem or adds prefixes or suffixes for different tenses and moods. I hope this helps! If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."
